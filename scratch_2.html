<p><font size="4">When I was 8 my family decided to move overseas to Germany where I attended an international school that my parents taught at as well. We lived abroad for 3 years where I began to pick up on the German language as well as assimilate to the Berlin culture, serving as the initial spark to my passion for exploring other countries and lifestyles.</p>
