<p><font size="4">I was born in Portland, Maine in 1997 and lived outside of the city for the first two years of my life. At the age of 2 I moved to a suburb outside of Dallas, Texas where I lived near my extended paternal family. This was my first experience in a populated city with any amenity you could need within a block or two of our "white picket" suburban home. </font></p>
