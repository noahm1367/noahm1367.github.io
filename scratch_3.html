<p><font size="4">Though I have not traveled much outside of the US as a college student, I fully intend to continue to explore the world once my lifestyle and means of income allow it. I am a student of Economics and International Affairs and have chosen my course of study as to reflect my goal of travel as well as position me for success in whatever field I may end up in. I know that I will continue to immerse myself in as many cultures, languages, and environments of the world as possible as I am still young and there is so much more to see.</font> </p>
